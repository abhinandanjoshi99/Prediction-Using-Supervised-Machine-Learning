# Prediction-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning

Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with Python Scikit Learn.

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 

After implementing with Linear Regression, we will also implement it with Logistic Regression in order to do a comparision between the accuracy of the two.
We find that Linear Regression is best for this particular data set compared to Logistic Regression.
